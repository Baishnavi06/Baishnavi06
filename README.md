### 👩‍💻 About Me

I am **Baishnavi Kumari**, a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate at **UCET, VBU Hazaribagh**. I am currently navigating the exciting early stages of my journey to become a proficient Software Engineer.

My academic focus is deeply rooted in building a strong technical foundation. While I am passionate about general software development, my long-term ambition is to specialize in the dynamic field of **Data Science**, where I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful innovation. Currently, I am honing my logic and problem-solving skills by mastering languages like **C, C++, and Python.**

> *"Every line of code is a step forward; I believe in debugging today to design a smarter tomorrow."*

### 🧠 My Tech Philosophy

I view technology not just as a tool, but as a language of possibility. My philosophy centers on **"Iterative Growth."** Just as software improves with every version update, I believe in constantly refactoring my skills—learning, unlearning, and relearning to keep pace with the evolving world of AI and Data Science.

### 📚 My Learning Approach

I believe in structured learning that evolves from strong foundations to specialized application. Here is how I am architecting my education:

| Phase of Learning | Focus Area | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: The Foundation** | **C & C++ Programming** | Mastering memory management, pointers, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to build rock-solid logic. |
| **Phase 2: The Interface** | **Web Development Basics** | Understanding how users interact with technology through HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. |
| **Phase 3: The Bridge** | **Python Mastery** | Transitioning from syntax to application. Focusing on Python libraries essential for automation and scripting. |
| **Phase 4: The Destination** | **Data Science & AI** | Applying Python skills to Data Analysis, Machine Learning models, and statistical computing. |
